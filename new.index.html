<h2>What is noruts.com?</h2>
A while ago there was a student government campaign.
<h2>Why is it on the ceiling?</h2>
They decided it would be good advertising to put signs up there. Obviously, it worked.
<h2>Why do I own it now?</h2>
The domain expired, and Google Domains gave me some credit, so I bought it as a promotional channel for <a href="http://www.robojackets.org/?utm_source=noruts.com&utm_medium=direct&utm_campaign=noruts">RoboJackets</a>. It works: back when we just did a hard redirect, about 8% of traffic to our website started here. We decided that was probably confusing, so now there's a nice landing page here for you.

We're a group of robotics teams that compete in a wide variety of collegiate competitions, including Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition, RoboRacing, RoboCup, BattleBots (yes, like the TV show), and an outreach team that primarily supports Atlanta area FRC teams. All we ask for is enthusiasm and willingness to learn, but if you already have experience that's awesome too! If you think you might be interested, come talk to us at a general interest meeting (list below) or <a href="http://www.robojackets.org/?utm_source=noruts.com&utm_medium=direct&utm_campaign=noruts">click here</a> to check out our website.<ul></ul>
